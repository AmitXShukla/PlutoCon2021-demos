# PlutoCon2021 demos

During the conference, we will host an <b>ONLINE DEMO PAGE</b> running all your submitted notebooks, for everyone to see! Just like the website <a href="https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/">https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/</a>, we will use our fancy new technology to run sliders, button, webcam inputs, etc. directly on the website.

## How do I submit a notebook?
<b>Would you like <em>your cool notebook</em> to become an interactive web page?</b> 
          
You can either:
1. email your notebook to fons@plutojl.org
2. open a Pull Request to this repository, adding your notebook.

Be sure to write your name and an introduction inside the notebook. Use <code>@bind</code> to make your notebook interactive!
